- Alperia

Problems/Issues:
- Not good at C/C++
- No idea if OS works
- OS needs to integrate with existing touch screen
- File scanning must be fast

TODO:
- Lockdown USB on insert
- Pay attention to autorun.inf -> Lockdown this file / Remove permissions

Privacy:
Captive portal that shows files with file path,
touch screen only shows score.

Add webpage that explains each type of possible malware to user


OS alternative:
- Use Tiny Core
- Use Raspbian lite and install needed stuff
