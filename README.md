## Introduction
Coming soon

## Instructions:
Coming soon

### Compilation instructions:
Prerequisites:
- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install [Tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/)

- #### Whole project
  If you want to compile the whole project, you first need to clone it to your computer. 
  Once thats done, you can unzip it and in the directory you can easily build the project with the command:
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
  The files will then be exported in the `out` directory, and an executable can be found at the path displayed in the console.

- #### Backend only
  The backend can operate without the GUI and you can find all the necessary files to compile it in the `src-tauri` directory
