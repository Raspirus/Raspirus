# Raspirus - Raspberry Pi Virusscanner

## Introduction
Even to this day, there are still some devices that for whatever reason can't have an antivirus or are outside the internet. 
This means that transferring files from your personal laptop or pc to these devices might be a very dangerous thing. Especially
when done with unsecured USB-sticks. To solve this issue, Raspirus has been invented. A black box where you attach your hard-drive
and it removes threats from it, making it safer.

## Design:
The design of the GUI is as easy and user-freindly as possible, without limiting its functionality. The whole Mockup of the app
has been planned and designed using Figma and you can take a look at the result using the link below:\
