# Antivirus Application Versioning and Release Schedule

## Version Naming Practice

We follow semantic versioning to clearly convey the nature of each release:

- **MAJOR version:** Increment for significant changes or major features.
- **MINOR version:** Increment for new features or functionality.
- **PATCH version:** Increment for bug fixes, optimizations, or minor improvements.

**Example:** Suppose our current version is 1.2.3. If we release a new feature, it might become version 2.0.0 or version 1.3.0. If we fix a bug without adding new features, it could be version 1.2.4.

## Release Schedule

Our release schedule is designed to balance feature development, stability, and security:

- **Regular Minor Releases:** Approximately every 2-3 months, we introduce new features and enhancements to keep the software evolving.

- **Monthly or Bi-Monthly Patch Releases:** Critical bug fixes and security updates are released as needed, ensuring your safety.

- **Major Releases:** Major milestones and significant overhauls are planned on an annual or semi-annual basis to allow users time to adapt.

- **Communication:** Stay informed about upcoming releases and features by checking our [project roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Raspirus/projects/3) and release notes or join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Vx7fW9PA8B).
